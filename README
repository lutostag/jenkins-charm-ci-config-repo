This is an example config-repo for the ci-configurator charm (that links to jenkins).

The layout is as follows:
├── control.yml -- a file that specifies dependencies to install
├── jenkins
│   └── jobs
│       ├── *.yml -- your jenkins job builder definitions
│       └── update -- what is run right before your update (must exist & exec'able)
├── setup.d -- any other scripts to be run on setup (must be exec'able)
│   └── README
└── unit_tests
    └── test.sh -- a simple test to see if your jenkins jobs are valid


For more information on jenkins-job-builder definitions look at http://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/definition.html
